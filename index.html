    <p id="p1">My name is Vincent Anthony Sarni III but I am known to most by Tony.  I am 30 years old and hail from the ever so wonderful state of Ohio.  I grew up in Toledo before moving to Cincinnati where I attended the University of Cincinnati.  I graduated in 2011 with a degree in Electronic Media with a strong focus on film and video editing.  I was fortunate enough to live in some amazing cities after graduation such as NYC and Chicago where I had the oppurtunity to work with some of the largest names in media and sports media including MLB Network, PGA, IMG Media, and The CW to name a few.
        However, shortly after moving to Nashville, TN I found myself less and less interested in video.</p>

    <p id="p2">It's funny how you spend so much time trying to decide what you want to do and then something you never thought of slaps you in the face.  Thats what happened to me with web design/coding.  I have always been a nerd and love anything tech related so even though the thought of it as a career never had crossed my mind it was the first thing that really peaked my interest as soon as I heard it.</p>
    
    <p id="p3">I have been loving every second of web design since the moment I started.  I love being able to create something from the ground up as well as problem solving when something isn't working the way it is intended.  I am beyond excited to keep learning and kick the door in on this new career path!</p>
